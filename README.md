# adventureGame

a simple ASCII RPG game written in C.

Q: why does this exist?
A: because I'm studying software development and I want to understand more about low-level programming. also, I really like the concept of text-based adventure games, so the game itself is built from love.

what do we have yet:
- A movable player
- Just that, lol

future plans:
- A map where the player moves in
- Inventory
- Enemies
- Randomly generated worlds
- Classes and races
- Weapons, armour and other items
